# Background

Radios are a type of communication device that utilizes electromagnetic radio waves between three hertz to 300 gigahertz. These waves are generated by a transmitter with an antenna, which radiates the radio waves. The first radio communication systems were developed in 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi and used Morse code.

# Strategies

## Using

- The radio's only function is to summon an [Airdrop](/obstacles/airdrop_crate) at the location where it is fired.
- It deals no damage and cannot be used as a [Weapon](/weapons).

# Obtaining

- Radios can be found rarely from common loot sources.

## Trivia

- The radio uses the same sound effects as the [Deathray](/weapons/guns/deathray) except for the firing sound
