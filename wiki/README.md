# Suroi Wiki

The autogenerated wiki for suroi.io.

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm build # builds the wiki
pnpm serve # serves the build output
```

## Directory Structure

```
- content (human written wiki content)
- pages (generated wiki content)
- public (static assets)
- scripts (bundled client scripts)
- styles (bundled client stylesheets)
- ssg (static site generation code)
- util (utility functions)
- config.ts (build configuration)
```

## Build Configuration `config.ts`

- `url` - the base url the wiki will be hosted on (required for opengraph thumbnails)
- `disableThumbnails` - disables opengraph thumbnail generation (as they take a long time to build)
